# 37. Build Order:
# You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs
# of projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a
# project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that
# will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return an error.
#
# EXAMPLE
# Input:
#   projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
#   dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
# Output: e, f, a, b, d, c
